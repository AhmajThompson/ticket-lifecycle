<p>
Intake
This is the initial stage where a ticket is created.
A user (customer, employee, or system) submits a request for support, reporting an issue or requesting a service.
The ticket is logged in the ticketing system with relevant details such as issue type, priority, and requester information.

<p>
Assignment and Communication
The ticket is assigned to the appropriate team or individual based on the issue type and urgency.
The assigned support agent or technician acknowledges receipt of the ticket.
Communication is established with the requester to confirm details, gather additional information if needed, and set expectations for resolution.

<p>
Working the Issue
The assigned agent begins troubleshooting and working towards resolving the issue.
If necessary, the issue may be escalated to a higher-tier support team.
Continuous updates are provided to the requester regarding the progress.
Collaboration with other teams may occur if the issue requires multiple expertise areas.

</p>
<p>
Resolution
The issue is resolved, and the resolution details are documented in the ticket.
The requester is informed of the resolution and may be asked to confirm that the issue has been resolved to their satisfaction.
If no further action is needed, the ticket is closed.
A post-resolution review may be conducted to identify patterns or improvements for future support processes.
